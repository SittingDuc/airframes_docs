# Overview

We have been building an API for authorized users to be able to query aggregated and processed Airframes data. There will be two classifications of authorized API users:
- **feeders**
- **customers**

**Feeders** (users who run a receiver that contributes data in real-time to Airframes) with a measure of *validated data* will receive a minimal, yet useful, free API account.

**Customers** (paying users/subscribers) will be able to access to the API in relation to tier. Initially this will be a nominal fee with no feeder requirement.

Coming soon. Stay tuned...
