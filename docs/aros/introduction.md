# Introduction to AirwavesOS

**AirwavesOS** is a custom operating system based on Debian Linux used for interacting with [Airframes](https://airframes.io) and other aggregation services. AirwavesOS is intended to be installed on low power embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi, but is also compatible with higher end PCs.

**AirwavesOS** provides:
- easy installation
- easy web-based configuration & management
- simplified updating and upgrading
- dashboard
- support for almost any type of SDR
- the use of multiple SDRs at the same time (limited only to system capacity)
- customizable outputs (send feed to log, another AROS node, aggregators)
- output to multiple outputs & aggregators per feed
