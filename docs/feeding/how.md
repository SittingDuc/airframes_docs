# How to Feed

Feeding requires that you have active reception of aerospace data (coming from aircraft, ground stations, etc) already using one or more SDRs.

## Feeder Clients

If you are using the [Airframes Receiver OS](https://docs.airframes.io/docs/aros), feeder clients are already installed for most services and ready for you to configure as an `Output`. You may feed multiple aggregation services.

If you are using an OS distribution from one of the other aggregation services, you will need to install and/or configure a feeding client in order to feed your data to these services. The rule of thumb is that the aggregator that put together the OS distribution will likely have already included their own feeder client, but you will likely need to add the feeder clients for any other aggregation service that you would like to feed to.
