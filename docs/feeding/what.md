# What is Feeding?

The often used term **feeding** is used to describe the action of gathering data and sending it to a remote service, usually an application or an aggregator (such as [Airframes](https://airframes.io) or [ADSBExchange](https://adsbexchange.com)) for further processing.

When you use your SDR to capture aircraft data from the sky and then send it to [Airframes](https://airframes.io), you are **feeding** data to us. From the perspective of the [Airframes](https://airframes.io) service, your receiver station is a **feeder** because it is **feeding** data to it. Your **feed** contains data that was captured by your receiver from aircraft in its vicinity.
