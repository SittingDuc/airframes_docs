# Introduction to ACARS

ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) is a digital communication system that is used to transmit and receive messages between aircraft and ground-based systems. It is a part of the aircraft's avionics system and is used for various purposes such as sending flight plans, weather reports, and maintenance messages. The original ACARS (often referred to as Plain Old ACARS, or POA) uses VHF (Very High Frequency) to transmit and receive data. The system is designed to improve communication efficiency and safety by providing real-time information to pilots and ground-based operators. ACARS is widely used in the aviation industry and has become an essential tool for modern aircraft operations.
