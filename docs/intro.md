# Introduction

[Airframes](https://airframes.io) is an aerospace aircraft data service that aggregates data in real-time from feeds in the field all around the world, processes the data, and makes available this data to the public.

Similar to [ADSBExchange](https://adsbexchange.com), all data that is collected and processed remains unfiltered and unbiased by governments, nation states, and corporate interests.

The nature of the data collected by [Airframes](https://airframes.io) is that it augments and enhances the data of existing aggregation services, providing a deeper look at aircraft internals, airline inter-communications, and aerospace systems that power our skies.
