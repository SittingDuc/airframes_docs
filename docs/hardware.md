To get started with feeding Airframes or ADS-B Exchange, you will first need to acquire the hardware necessary to receive signals from nearby
airframes (commonly known as aircraft) and ground stations.

## Software Defined Radio

[ADSBExchange.com Orange SDR](https://www.amazon.com/ADSBexchange-com-Orange-R860-RTL2832U-TCXO/dp/B09NJWMY56?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=airframes07-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=b8c22b69822d02b6f223318844d22d08&camp=1789&creative=9325)

The official branded Orange SDR from ADS-B Exchange (and Airframes.io) is unfiltered (unlike the Blue SDR which contains a filter intended for ADS-B traffic at 1090mhz) and ideal for ACARS or VDL.
