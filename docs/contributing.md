# Contributing

We have had a lot of requests by excited & helpful people who want to contribute and help the project. While we are still figuring out all of the details, here are some opportunities you can explore to help Airframes out.

## Help the Community

Provide others in the community with support and tips/tricks. Answer people's questions in the Discord, or elsewhere on the net. Outside of the duties of moderators, you also can help keep people positive and excited to explore the hobby.

## Contribute Documentation

We have several documentation efforts. The first is this site you are reading right now. The second is researching and documenting the ACARS message text payload, so that we can further fine tune and develop the ACARS message text decoders.

* [Airframes Documentation](https://github.com/airframesio/docs)
* [ACARS Message Documentation](https://github.com/airframesio/acars-message-documentation)

## Development

Our plan is to open source much of what we have been working on. Some things will remain private temporarily, so that we can ensure some structure and test ideas before they are released to the public to contribute to. Some things may always remain private, simply because not everything will have general community benefit or would allow multi-million or billion dollar corporations to leap frog our efforts before we've had a chance to get off the ground.

If you are a developer and want to contribute a small fix, a feature, or take on a larger role, there are several efforts that will greatly benefit the Airframes, aviation tracking, and radio communities at large.

* [ACARS Decoder Typescript](https://github.com/airframesio/acars-decoder-typescript)
* [ACARS Decoder Rust](https://github.com/airframesio/acars-decoder-rust)
* [Airwaves OS](https://github.com/airframesio/airwaves-os)

## Patreon

Become a Patreon! By spending a monthly allotment that you can afford as a Patreon, you help to provide much needed funds for servers, hosting, design & dev time, and maybe a coffee or two. We are still fleshing out the Patreon tiers (a way of giving back to Patreons at different levels), but we have some great stuff up our sleeves.

Visit the [Airframes Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Airframes) to help out right away! If you're on the Discord, send a moderator a message and you will be rewarded with a special Patreon role that will grant you access to additional channels (we are looking to automate this).

## Buy From Our Shop

Visit the [Airframes Shop](https://shop.airframes.io) to purchase swag, SDRs, SBCs, cables, antennas, and other hardware. All purchases directly support the development and server costs.
