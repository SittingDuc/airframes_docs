# Getting Started

If you're already familiar with aircraft tracking in general, you might want to dive right in.

If you're not yet familiar with aircraft tracking and the technologies it involves, it is suggested that you read the [Technology Overview](/docs/technology/overview) and [What is Feeding?](/docs/feeding/what) first.

## Steps to Begin Now

1. [Determine what kind of system you want to set up](/docs/technology/receiver-systems).
2. Acquire the parts.
3. Install the operating system and related software.
4. Configure the software and test the receptions of data from the airwaves.
5. Setup to feed data to additional aggregators.
